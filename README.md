# College Majors

Jupyter Notebook exploring a dataset on past and current college students, their majors, and their foray into the workplace

**Data Source**

**Main Questions**

1. Focusing on the data available for all ages, what does the distribution of unemployment rates look like among the different major categories? Come up with a graphical display that allows a reader to easily make sense of the information.
2. In addition to the comprehensive, all-ages dataset, the github repository also contains data regarding just recent college graduates (ages < 28). Comparing this subset of data to the whole dataset that it comes from (all-ages) can provide us with some information about recent trends. Which majors appear to have experienced a relative boom among recent graduates and which majors are dropping off in popularity? Again, explore visual ways of describing the answer as well as numerical ones.
3. (Bonus) The previous two questions deal with only a small subset of the data contained in the repository. If you have some extra time, we would be curious to see something else interesting you found while exploring the data. Additionally, if there are other variables or similar data sets that you could see being useful to add to this data set, feel free to mention them here! What would you use this additional data for?
