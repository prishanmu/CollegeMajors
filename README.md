## Project Description

This project is a Flask app that visualizes unemployment rates based on college major and major types for recent grads and grads of all ages.  

## How to run

1. install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. then you should run with `python collegemajors.py runserver`
3. follow the Flask app routes as written below to get to each page

## How to use

1. A useful instruction goes here
2. A useful second step here
3. (Optional): Markdown syntax to include an screenshot/image: ![alt text](image.jpg)

## Routes in this application
- `/home` -> this is the home page
- `/form` -> this route has a form for user input
- `/result` -> this route is where the form sends the result...
- `/newuser/<username>` -> this route also takes input of a name and shows you a greeting

## How to run tests
1. First... (e.g. access a certain directory if necessary)
2. Second (e.g. any other setup necessary)
3. etc (e.g. run the specific test file)
NOTE: Need not have 3 steps, but should have as many as are appropriate!
